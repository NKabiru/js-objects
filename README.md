## Objects, Functions, Closures and Prototypes

Today you will study on the Javascript language and gain proficiency in it. You should begin with the introduction to the JavaScript language and then study on the Object oriented principles as implemented in JavaScript. By the end of the day you should have proper understanding on:

- JavaScript Functions 
- Closures 
- Prototypes

A report will be expected at the end of the day along with a code sample in github implementing some of the above components.
